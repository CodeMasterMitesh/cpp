What is a Friend Function?
A function that is not a member of a class but has access to the private and protected members of the class.
Declared using the keyword friend inside the class definition.
Defined like a normal function outside the class.
Helps in implementing non-member functions that still need access to the class's internals.


Key Characteristics
Not a Member: A friend function is not called with a class object; itâ€™s called like a regular function.
Access to Private Members: It can access all private and protected members of the class.
Defined Outside the Class: After declaration inside the class, it must be implemented externally.
Declared Explicitly: Explicitly marked as friend inside the class.
